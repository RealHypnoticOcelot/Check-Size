# Check Size
###### Check the size of multiple files in a directory, at once!



## How to use:
All you have to do is make sure you have Python installed, and run the following command:

```python
python3 size.py
```

Note that it checks if a file is above or below a certain megabyte threshold, you could use it to list the size of all files just by setting it to a very large number and checking for less.
